# SKS-PyCS
Teaching materials for Smart Kids Python for Computer Scientists course

## Setup
Follow the instructions in [Setup.md](Setup.md)

## The course
We will be generally following the online edition [Learning With Python 3 RLE](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/) 
of an open source book 
[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491939362/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1491939362&linkCode=as2&tag=greenteapre01-20&linkId=QGWNVBOEV6JIMH4Y).

Please see the links above for credits.

Note that the RLE edition that we will be using deviates in substantial ways from the last printed edition of the book available on Amazon. I leave up to you if you still want to get a paper copy for yourself.

The Python environment that we will be using \(Jupyter Notebooks\) is different from the environment used in the book \(either RLE or the prior paper edition\). Therefore, make sure that you follow the **Setup** instructions linked above and verify 
that you are actually able to start Python3 Jupyter Notebook and execute commands *before you come to class*. At the first class session, we will address any problems that you might have encountered while setting up your environemnt at home.
