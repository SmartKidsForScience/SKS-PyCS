We will be using Python 3

As a programming environment, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks.

To install Python and Jupyter Notebooks, follow the 
[Software Carpentry Setup instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/)
for installing the Anaconda distribution. Using Anaconda greatly simplifies the installation process,
especially on Windows and when it comes to obtaining the non-Python dependencies.

Note: the setup on Windows instructs you to make the Anaconda Python the default Python on your system. 
If you already have another Python installation that you want to keep as a default, you can choose not to make
the Anaconda Python a default one. You will need to learn how to start the Anaconda Python for our course, and
not your previous install.

To make sure that you have created a working installation:
  - start Jupyter Notebooks per the setup guide above
  - create New notebook
  - in the input cell, type `print("Hello")` and press Shift-Enter (or click the Play menu button). 
    You should see `Hello` printed in the Out cell.

If you run into problems, submit an [Issue at our GitHub repository](https://github.com/SmartKidsForScience/SKS-PyCS/issues).
