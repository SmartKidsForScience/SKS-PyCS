What is the most basic model of a universal computing machine?

# Explore 2D Turing Machine
 
 - Machine that has two dimensional "tape". The machine moves on that tape/canvas.
 - 2D machine makes it easier to create visual demonstrations of
   its behaviour.
 - We will use a Java implementation [TuringKara](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/turingkara/index.html).
 - Download JAR file for Java 8, English Version, with solutions, from [here](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/download.html). 
   Use Google translate to read the page if you do not know German.
 - Install Java on your computer if needed. Download from Oracle, or use conda, brew 
   or whatever you prefer.

# Exploring the maze with 2D Turing Machine

 - Open the [English manual](http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/turingkara/docs/turingkara_manual-en.pdf) and study how to program and operate the machine.
 - We will load one the maze problems from Exercises menu, run the machine, and study 
   how the states and positions on the 2D tape change.

# Notes on working with TuringKara

 - Do not confuse moves with states (the names are the same). Move is where you are going;
   state is in what direction you stepped in the last time. 
 - Double moves per transition can be used to instantly backtrack from the #. 
 - There is also an alphabet symbol for the move, which is written to point in 
   the direction opposite to the state name in which is was written.
 - States are explored clockwise; this way once we get to South, we already know 
   that we explored the neighbourhood, and thus we can start backtracking if we 
   are on an arrow cell.
